    summary: Open-source graph inspired by Freebase and Google's Knowledge Graph.
    description: |
      Gateway is an open-source graph inspired by the graph database behind Freebase and Google's Knowledge Graph.
      Its goal is to be a part of the developer's toolbox where Linked Data and graph-shaped data
      (semantic webs, social networks, etc) in general are concerned.
